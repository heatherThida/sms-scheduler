# SMS Scheduler
SMS Scheduler is an experimental project to schedule and send sms messages.

## Features

## Getting Started

### Install
To run this locally, you'll need to clone the site, set up a database and add the credentials to /includes/config.php.
Also, you'll need to set up a cron job to run every five minutes so that it picks up the sms to send.

### System Requirements

You need **PHP >= 5.3.0** and **Mysql >= 5.5.0**.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the Sms-Scheduler repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **develop** branch

### Style Guide
I'm currently using Zend Framework standard.

## Current Status
It's currently in pre-alpha stage and would need a lot more to get to alpha or beta. Pull requests are certainly welcome.
